# awesome-math
This page contains maths resources that I used for studying. I only post resources which I used to actually learn the subject - no cookbooks or encyclopedias. I don't make an attempt to only collect free resources.

## Contribute
I would be very grateful if you could share something awesome you have come across with me.
You can drop me an email if you would like to recommend something to r.zayt at mail dot ru. I will have to use it myself before I add it to the list though.
