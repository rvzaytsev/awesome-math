# awesome-math
This page contains maths resources that I used for studying. I only post resources which I covered from start to end (or almost), i.e. something I used to learn the subject completely on my own and successfully - no cookbooks and encyclopedias. I don't make an attempt to only collect free resources, so no links, just titles.
